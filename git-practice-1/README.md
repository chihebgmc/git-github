# Practice One

## 1. Create a New Directory

- Right click on your desktop, click on `Git Bach Here`. This will open your desktop directory in `Git Bach`
- Create a new directory for your project called `git-practice-1`.
- Add `README.md`, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` files inside of it.

## 2. Track Files with Git

- Check the status of your repository.

To start tracking files, add them to the staging area:

- Add `README.md` file to the staging area.
- Check again the status of your repository.
- Add all files in the directory to the staging area.

## 3. Commit Your Changes

- Once your files are staged, commit them to your repository.
- Check the history of commits.
